# Introducing Pods in Kubernetes - II: Pod YAML Manifest

> — Laozi

In my [previous post](https://wang-engineer.github.io/blogger/posts/2025-06-23-pod-1-introduction.md), we introduced the concept of Pods in Kubernetes—what they are, how they fit into the Kubernetes architecture, and why they are the smallest deployable unit in a cluster. Now, we’ll transition from theory to practice by exploring the YAML manifest used to define a Pod and focus on several important container-level configurations.

To start a pod in Kubernetes, you may use `kubectl run` (imperative way) with an exposed port:

```bash
kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx:1.25 --port=80 
```

This creates a Pod named `nginx-pod` running the `nginx:1.25` image and opens port 80. It is useful for quick testing, but for production or repeatable deployments, YAML manifests are preferred. 

For example, imagine you need to recreate the same Pod after a crash, or you want to deploy the same Pod across multiple environments like dev, staging, and production. If you only used kubectl run, you’d need to remember or script out all the command-line options, which can be error-prone and hard to maintain. Therefore, instead of manually creating Pods using `kubectl run` or other imperative commands, Kubernetes encourages the use of **declarative configuration** via YAML files. This approach provides better reproducibility, version control, and consistency across environments.

In this post, we’ll walk through a complete Pod manifest and break down key sections commonly used in production deployments. These configurations ensure your containers are healthy, efficient, and secure. We'll cover:

- Pod Metadata and Spec
- Readiness Probe
- Liveness Probe
- CPU/Memory Requests and Limits
- Volumes and VolumeMounts
- Environment Variables from Secrets

## Sample Pod YAML Manifest

Here’s a complete sample YAML manifest demonstrating best practices for configuring a container inside a Pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-app
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: sample
    environment: production
spec:
  containers:
    - name: sample-container
      image: nginx:1.25
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "64Mi"
          cpu: "250m"
        limits:
          memory: "128Mi"
          cpu: "500m"
      readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /
          port: 80
        initialDelaySeconds: 5
        periodSeconds: 10
        failureThreshold: 3
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /
          port: 80
        initialDelaySeconds: 15
        periodSeconds: 20
        failureThreshold: 3
      volumeMounts:
        - name: app-config
          mountPath: /etc/config
          readOnly: true
      envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: app-secret
      env:
        - name: API_KEY
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: app-secret
              key: api-key
  volumes:
    - name: app-config
      configMap:
        name: app-config
```

## Pod Metadata and Spec

The top-level fields of a Pod YAML define its identity and structure.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-app
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: sample
    environment: production
spec:
  ...
```

- **apiVersion**: Specifies the Kubernetes API version (e.g., `v1` for core resources like Pods).
- **kind**: Defines the resource type, here a `Pod`.
- **metadata**: Contains identifying information:
  - **name**: A unique name for the Pod within its namespace.
  - **namespace**: The Kubernetes namespace (e.g., `default`). If omitted, the Pod is created in the `default` namespace.
  - **labels**: Key-value pairs for organization and selection (e.g., by Services or Deployments). Here, `app: sample` and `environment: production` help identify the Pod's purpose and environment.
- **spec**: The specification of the Pod’s desired state, including its containers, volumes, and other configurations.

**Why it matters**: Proper metadata ensures the Pod is uniquely identifiable and can be targeted by other Kubernetes resources like Services or HorizontalPodAutoscalers. Incorrect or missing metadata can lead to naming conflicts or Pods being unselectable by controllers.

---

## Readiness Probe

The readiness probe determines when a container is ready to accept traffic. Until the probe passes, the Pod is excluded from Service endpoints, preventing traffic from reaching an unready container.

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: 80
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
  failureThreshold: 3
```

- **httpGet**: Probes the container by sending an HTTP GET request to `/` on port 80.
- **initialDelaySeconds**: Waits 5 seconds after container startup before starting probes, allowing the application time to initialize.
- **periodSeconds**: Checks every 10 seconds.
- **failureThreshold**: Requires 3 consecutive failures to mark the container as not ready.

**What happens if it fails?**: If the probe fails (e.g., the endpoint returns a non-2xx HTTP status), Kubernetes marks the container as "Not Ready," and the Pod is removed from Service endpoints. This prevents traffic from being routed to an unhealthy container, ensuring reliability. Once the probe succeeds, the Pod is added back to the Service.

**Use case**: Useful for applications that need time to load configurations or establish database connections before handling requests.

---

## Liveness Probe

The liveness probe checks if a container is still healthy. If it fails, Kubernetes restarts the container to recover it.

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: 80
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  periodSeconds: 20
  failureThreshold: 3
```

- **httpGet**: Sends an HTTP GET request to `/` on port 80.
- **initialDelaySeconds**: Waits 15 seconds before starting probes, giving the container time to stabilize.
- **periodSeconds**: Checks every 20 seconds.
- **failureThreshold**: Marks the container as unhealthy after 3 consecutive failures.

**What happens if it fails?**: If the probe fails (e.g., due to a crashed application or unresponsive endpoint), Kubernetes restarts the container. This is useful for recovering from deadlocks, memory leaks, or other issues that cause the application to become unresponsive.

**Use case**: Essential for long-running applications where temporary failures (e.g., a stuck process) can be resolved by restarting the container.

## CPU and Memory: Requests and Limits

Resource requests and limits help Kubernetes schedule Pods and manage resource contention.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "64Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

- **requests**: Specifies the minimum resources guaranteed to the container:
  - **memory: "64Mi"**: Ensures 64 mebibytes of memory.
  - **cpu: "250m"**: Guarantees 0.25 CPU cores (250 milliCPU).
- **limits**: Caps the maximum resources the container can use:
  - **memory: "128Mi"**: Limits memory to 128 mebibytes.
  - **cpu: "500m"**: Limits CPU to 0.5 cores.

**What happens if limits are exceeded?**:
- **Memory**: If the container exceeds the memory limit, it is terminated with an OutOfMemory (OOM) error, and Kubernetes restarts it. This prevents a single container from starving the node of memory.
- **CPU**: If the CPU limit is exceeded, the container is throttled, meaning it gets less CPU time, but it won’t be terminated. This ensures fair CPU sharing among Pods.

**Why it matters**: Requests help Kubernetes schedule Pods on nodes with sufficient resources, while limits prevent resource hogging, ensuring cluster stability.

## Volumes and VolumeMounts

Volumes provide persistent or shared data to containers, such as configuration files or persistent storage.

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: app-config
    configMap:
      name: app-config
```

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: app-config
    mountPath: /etc/config
    readOnly: true
```

- **volumes**: Defines a volume named `app-config` sourced from a ConfigMap named `app-config`. ConfigMaps store key-value pairs or files that can be mounted into containers.
- **volumeMounts**: Mounts the `app-config` volume at `/etc/config` inside the container. The `readOnly: true` ensures the mounted files cannot be modified by the container.

**What is it used for?**: Volumes like ConfigMaps are ideal for injecting configuration files, such as Nginx server configs or application settings, without modifying the container image. They decouple configuration from code, making applications more portable and easier to update.

**What happens if misconfigured?**: If the ConfigMap doesn’t exist or the mount path conflicts with existing files, the container may fail to start or behave unexpectedly. Always ensure the referenced ConfigMap exists in the same namespace.

---

## Environment Variables from Secrets

Secrets securely store sensitive data like API keys or passwords and can be injected as environment variables.

```yaml
envFrom:
  - secretRef:
      name: app-secret
env:
  - name: API_KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: app-secret
        key: api-key
```

- **envFrom**: Automatically sets all key-value pairs from the `app-secret` Secret as environment variables in the container. For example, if `app-secret` contains `username: admin` and `password: secret123`, these become environment variables `username` and `password`.
- **env**: Selectively retrieves a specific key (`api-key`) from the `app-secret` Secret and assigns it to the environment variable `API_KEY`.

**What if I want a specific secret?**: Use the `env` field with `secretKeyRef` (as shown) to retrieve only specific keys from a Secret, rather than exposing all key-value pairs. This is more secure and avoids cluttering the environment with unnecessary variables. By the way, the `env` field is not necessary if all the envs are already populated by `envFrom`. It is just for demonstration here.

**What happens if misconfigured?**: If the Secret `app-secret` doesn’t exist or the `api-key` key is missing, the container will fail to start. Ensure the Secret exists in the same namespace and contains the expected keys.

**Why it matters**: Secrets provide a secure way to manage sensitive data, reducing the risk of exposing credentials in logs or container images.
