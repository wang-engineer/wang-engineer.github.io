# Understanding `deployment.yaml` in Kubernetes with an example
> üí¨ *‚ÄúÂ§ßÈÅìÁîöÂ§∑ÔºåËÄå‰∫∫Â•ΩÂæÑ„ÄÇ(The great Dao is perfectly level, yet people love to take narrow, winding paths.)‚Äù*

## Introduction: Why Learn the `deployment.yaml`?

If you‚Äôve ever opened a `deployment.yaml` file and thought, *‚ÄúWhoa, what‚Äôs going on here?‚Äù* ‚Äî you‚Äôre not alone. YAML files in Kubernetes can feel cryptic, especially when you're just getting started with DevOps, MLOps, or deploying machine learning services into production. Even experienced software or ML engineers might glance at a line like `emptyDir: {}` or `livenessProbe:` and think, *‚ÄúIs this some kind of magic incantation?‚Äù*

The truth is: this file is **a blueprint** that tells Kubernetes how to run your application ‚Äî how many copies (replicas), how much memory or CPU it needs, what to do if something breaks, and even how to keep it connected to the rest of the world. It‚Äôs powerful, but because it does so much, it can feel overwhelming.

For example, many people assume:
- That `name: my-app` under `metadata` names the **Pod** ‚Äî but it actually names the **Deployment**.
- That `resources.limits` is just a suggestion ‚Äî when in fact, going over that memory limit can get your container **killed**.
- Or that `readinessProbe` is just another way to check if the app is alive ‚Äî but it‚Äôs actually about whether the app is ready to **serve real traffic** (very different from being ‚Äújust alive‚Äù).

This guide breaks down a real-world `deployment.yaml` file into easy-to-understand parts using collapsible sections, so you can explore them at your own pace. Whether you're deploying an NGINX web server, a Python FastAPI app, or a machine learning model behind a REST API, understanding this file gives you control ‚Äî and confidence ‚Äî when pushing code into Kubernetes.

So let‚Äôs walk through each part of the file and demystify it, line by line. By the end, the only YAML-induced anxiety you‚Äôll have is trying to remember whether it‚Äôs 2 spaces or 4. *(It‚Äôs 2. Always 2.)*

## What This Deployment Actually Does

Now that we‚Äôve explored each section of the YAML file line by line, let‚Äôs take a step back and talk through what this whole file accomplishes ‚Äî not in fragments, but as a story.

This deployment manifest creates a **Kubernetes Deployment** named `my-app`, which acts as a controller to manage a set of identical Pods. It specifies that Kubernetes should always keep **three replicas** of the application running. That means if one Pod fails, crashes, or is terminated (for example, due to a node failure), Kubernetes will immediately spin up a new one to maintain the desired state. This design ensures high availability and fault tolerance, which are essential for any production-grade application.

Inside each of these Pods is a single container based on the `nginx:1.25` image ‚Äî a popular web server. This container listens on **port 80**, which is the standard port for HTTP traffic. If you were to expose this Deployment using a Kubernetes `Service`, traffic from outside the cluster could be routed to this port, allowing users to access the web server from their browsers or other clients.

The Deployment also defines **resource requests and limits** for the container. Each instance is guaranteed 250 millicores of CPU and 64Mi of memory, meaning the scheduler will only place it on a node with at least that much available. However, the container is not allowed to consume more than 500 millicores and 128Mi. If it exceeds the memory limit, Kubernetes will terminate it with an out-of-memory (OOM) error. These constraints prevent the container from consuming excessive resources, helping to maintain cluster stability ‚Äî especially when multiple workloads share the same nodes.

<details>
<summary><strong>ü©∫ Liveness and Readiness Probes (click to expand)</strong></summary>

To monitor container health, the manifest includes two types of probes: `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe`.

- The **liveness probe** checks whether the application is still running properly. It performs an HTTP GET request to the root path `/` on port 80. If the application fails this check repeatedly, Kubernetes assumes it's unhealthy and will restart the container automatically.

- The **readiness probe** also sends an HTTP GET to `/`, but its purpose is slightly different. It checks whether the application is ready to **serve user traffic**. If this probe fails, the container stays alive, but it is removed from the pool of endpoints behind any Kubernetes `Service`, meaning it won't receive traffic until it passes the check again.

This distinction between *liveness* (is it running?) and *readiness* (can it serve?) is crucial for smooth, resilient deployments.

</details>

Another important feature in this manifest is the **ephemeral volume**. Each container mounts a volume named `html-volume` at the path `/usr/share/nginx/html`, which is where NGINX typically serves static files. The backing volume is an `emptyDir`, meaning it's a temporary storage area that exists only for the lifetime of the Pod. It‚Äôs wiped clean if the Pod is deleted or restarted. This can be useful for caching, staging content dynamically, or running test workloads that don‚Äôt require long-term data persistence.

Altogether, this Deployment manifest represents a compact but powerful configuration that introduces many core Kubernetes concepts: desired state management, replication, resource allocation, container health checks, and volume mounting. Even though it deploys a simple web server, it lays the foundation for understanding how Kubernetes orchestrates and safeguards workloads in real-world environments.

## Deployment Command
Once you‚Äôve written and saved your `deployment.yaml` file, you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster with the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
To verify and check status of the deployment, pod, containers:

```bash
# Check the status of the Deployment
kubectl get deployments

# View the status of the Pods
kubectl get pods

# Describe the Deployment in detail
kubectl describe deployment my-app

# Stream logs from a container
kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
```
